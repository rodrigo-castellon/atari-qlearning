# atari-qlearning
Project at MPCR for trying new ways of doing RL in an atari environment. This is modified code from https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn/blob/master/examples/reinforcement_learning/atari_1step_qlearning.py

Performance on atari games using [frame differences][framediffcode] was compared to the [original][originalcode] from [TFLearn examples][examples], which used 4 last states as input to the deep q-network.
